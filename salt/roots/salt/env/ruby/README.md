RVM may be overkill since we only require a single Ruby version for this environment, however, due to Salt's built in RVM support, this makes the most sense for long-term maintenance. The only caveat to the ease of using Salt's built in support lies in the recently heightened security around RVM installation. This requires us to add the GPG signature step covered in the `rvm_gpg_signature` directive. See [Issue 3110](https://github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm/issues/3110) in RVM's source repo for the conversation and justification for the GPG signature.
